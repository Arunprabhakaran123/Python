# Titanic Dataset Analysis 


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling on the Titanic dataset using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. This repository demonstrates how to clean data, visualize survival patterns, and build basic machine learning models.

Data cleaning — handling missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked), correcting data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis — visualizing survival by gender, class, age group, and embarkation point.

Feature engineering — creating derived features (family size, title from names, age bins).

Statistical analysis — survival rates by categorical features.

Visualization — using matplotlib & seaborn for charts.
